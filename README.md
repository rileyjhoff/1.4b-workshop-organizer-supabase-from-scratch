## The Golden Rule:

ü¶∏ ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `Stop starting and start finishing.` üèÅ

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

1. **Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"**
1. **Once you have a drawing, name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision**
1. **For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this?**
1. **Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"**
1. **Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, on load etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change?**
1. **Think about how to validate each of your features according to a Definition of Done**
1. **Consider what features _depend_ on what other features. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.**

Additional considerations:

- Ask: which of your HTML elements need to be hard coded, and which need to be dynamically generated?
- Consider your data model.
  - What kinds of objects (i.e., Dogs, Friends, Todos, etc) will you need?
  - What are the key/value pairs?
  - What arrays might you need?
  - What needs to live in a persistence layer?
- Is there some state we need to initialize?
- Ask: should any of this work be abstracted into functions? (i.e., is the work complicated? can it be reused?)

# Workshop Organizer

## Demo

[Link to Demo](https://alchemy-web-workshop-organizer.netlify.app/)

## Getting Started

Use [this template](https://github.com/alchemycodelab/web-template-supabase) to get started.

Create a supbase project with a `workshops` table and a `participants` table. Add a few rows to your workshops table in the supabase.io dashboard.

For the workshops and the participants use `(role() = 'authenticated'::text)` for all CRUD actions row level security.

### Learning Objectives

- Create foreign key relationships in Supabase
- Use the Supabase JS client to fetch related data in Supabase
- Use the Supabase JS client to create data with foreign-key relationships in Supabase

### Description

We will be creating a Workshop Organizer. This app allows you to add participants to workshops.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Users should be able to see a list of workshops with participants on `/workshops`
- Clicking on a participant should delete it from supabase and rerender the list of workshops
- The `/create` page should have a prefilled dropdown menu with the list of workshops from supabase
- Submitting the form on the `/create` page should create a new participant in the workshop and redirect the user back to the `/workshops` page

### Stretch Goals Ideas

1. Add a page that lets you create a new workshop
2. On click, don't delete the participant--go to the participant's "detail page". The detail page will have an interface that lets the user update the participant. This includes allowing the user to change which workshop the participant belongs to.
3. Automatically generate the participant form using a participant fetched from the database. That way if new properties end up added to the participant table, the front end dev doesn't need to update the front end later.
4. Add filter/sort functionality to the workshops page? Only show participants who are older than 21, for example? Only show workshops with more than 2 participants?
5. _Mega ambitious_: I want to able to drag and drop participants to different workshops.
